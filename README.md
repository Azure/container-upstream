# Azure Container Compute Upstream Projects

This list of projects is maintained by the Azure container compute upstream team. This list is intended to help you make informed decisions about what projects to use (or not use) in the context of your goals (e.g. proof of concept vs. production). To make this decision you need to consider your goals, your need for formal support, the project's [maturity](#Maturity), governance, version level, and your willingness to work in open source.

## Support

Projects listed on this page are open source that Microsoft maintain or contribute to. These projects are [**NOT** covered by the Microsoft Azure support policy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2941892/support-for-linux-and-open-source-technology-in-azure). To get help please search the open issues on the project using the links in the table. To communicate with the Azure Container Compute Upstream team please use the [issues](https://github.com/Azure/container-compute-upstream/issues) in this repo. If your issue isn't already represented, please open a new one. However, if you consume one of these projects as a part of a Microsoft or Azure product or service, you may be eligible for [support through that product or service](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/hub/4343728/support-for-business).

## Maturity

Open source project maturity can be assessed on many dimensions including age, number of contributors, diversity of contributor employers, and many more. Two you should consider are represented in the table as:

* Project state - The first entry in the Maturity column represents the project's status. Projects in the CNCF (kubernetes, kubernetes-sigs, prometheus, etc) use the [CNCF maturity model](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc). Projects in the Azure, Microsoft, or deislabs GitHub orgs are working towards using the [guaduation guidelines](process/graduation_guidelines.md) defined in this repo. 
* [API or Feature Versions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning) if relevant, are listed as the second entry of the Maturity column, and follow the Kubernetes convention except where noted
